# ICBC-Analysis
The goal of my project is to predict the risk of luxury cars needing to claim insurance based on their location, using real-world ICBC data\


Tools/languages used during the Data ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) Process:\
    Tableau Public - ICBC data hosted on here (Extract)\
    Tabula - Software used to convert a PDF dataset into a CSV file (Extract)\
    SQL - Language used to write queries (Transforming/Cleaning data)\
    MySQL - Software used to write queries (Transforming/Cleaning data)\
    Excel - Software used to clean and organize data from ICBC before uploading onto MySQL (Transform)\
    Microsoft PowerBI - Software used to upload transformed data from MySQL to visualize results (Load)\
# Written Report (Coming Soon)
Once the data is fully analyzed, I will be creating a written report of my conclusion\
Will include limitations, points of difficulty, thought processes, potential future applications
