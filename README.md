# ICBC-Analysis Project Goal
The goal of my project is to predict the likelihood of luxury vehicle insurance claims across Lower Mainland using real-world ICBC data


# Tools/languages used during the Data ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) Process:
Tableau Public - ICBC data hosted on here (Extract)\
Tabula - Software used to convert a PDF dataset into a CSV file (Extract)\
SQL - Language used to write queries (Transforming/Cleaning data)\
MySQL - Software used to write queries (Transforming/Cleaning data)\
Excel - Software used to clean and organize data from ICBC before uploading onto MySQL (Transform)\
Microsoft PowerBI - Software used to upload transformed data from MySQL to visualize results (Load)
# Written Report (Coming Soon)
Once the data is fully analyzed, I will be creating a written report of my conclusion\
Will include limitations, points of difficulty, thought processes, potential future applications
